When Odysseus washes up on shore, he is “a terrible sight,
all crusted, caked with grime” as well as naked (172). A sight like this 
would have been alarming, certainly motivating Nausicaa to flee in terror.
Odysseus has to hurdle this obstacle, and that he does by delivering a compelling 
speech to the girl. He craftily slips in hints that he possessed “a great army” 
and that he believes in the gods like any civilized person, which both help shed 
he physical impression Odysseus confronts Nausicaa with (173). Also, Odysseus is 
able to sense Nausicaa’s deepest desire at the time, which is a husband to live 
with for all of her life. By observing this, Odysseus is able to allude to her wish
for marriage in his speech with phrases like “but he is the one more blest than all
other men who / leads you home, his bride” (173) and “may the good gods give you 
all your heart’s desires: husband, house and lasting harmony too” (174) in order to 
sway Nausicaa’s train of thought from Odysseus’ horrendous appearance to other, 
happier matters. With these favorable thoughts implanted in her head, Nausicaa 
decides to take pity on Odysseus, and take him to the palace to be taken care of.
Although Athena helped to bring Nausicaa to Odysseus’ location, Odysseus was still 
responsible for convincing the girl to take care of him, wich was the more
difficult part of thre plan. Without Odysseus’ superb ability to speak, Nausicaa
would have run away, leaving his quest home halted indefinitely at Phaeacia.
